### Tools
- Your organization uses a mix of Microsoft based products and open source tools.
- PowerBI for visualization and automated reports

### Tasks
- The IT team says the data currently sits in an SQL server database. They have extracted the database tables in csv files because they are unable to grant you access to the database. There are 7 tables containing customer and sales information. Import these csv files into a MySQL database on your own system.
- Using SQL, generate the reports in CSV tables which will provide the management team with insights required for items 1-5 in the mail from your boss. Beyond generating reports in tables, provide a short write up on your insights from the data generated.
- Using PowerBI, you are expected to create stunning visual reports on items 1-4. Your organization has predefined PowerBI templates for its reports developed by a consultant. The consultant refers you to the link below to help you get inspiration on captivating templates... https://youtu.be/KZDFw_G-Rj8. Answering item 5 in PowerBI is optional. 

**Tip** - for the key customer segments, you can explore using an RFM segmentation model  (recency, frequency and monetary model). Resources on RFM will be provided during the course.

 
### Deliverables
- Generate table reports in CSV which will provide the management team with insights required for items 1-5 in the brief. Complete this in SQL. Beyond generating reports in tables, provide a short write up on your insights from the data generated.e.g. These are top 10 customers by revenue, the customers accounted for >60% of our revenue.
- Create stunning PowerBI visualisations which will guide the management team in making optimal decisions for items 1-4 in the brief. Complete this in PowerBI
